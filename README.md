# Monster Card Battler

A single-player, turn-based monster card battle game built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Face off against a basic AI opponent using decks of procedurally generated monsters, ensuring unique stats, abilities, names, and abstract art every game!

## Features

*   **Procedural Monster Generation:** Monsters (stats, names, abilities, elements) are generated uniquely for each game using JavaScript, providing high replayability.
*   **Abstract Procedural Art:** Monster visuals are generated dynamically using the HTML Canvas API based on their properties (element, stats, cost), ensuring visual relevance without pre-made assets. Includes multiple base shapes (circle, square, triangle, hexagon, blob, biped, eye, flame) and visual modifiers.
*   **Core Card Game Mechanics:** Mana system, drawing cards, playing minions to a 1x5 grid, attacking minions or the enemy hero.
*   **Implemented Abilities/Keywords:**
    *   Taunt
    *   Rush
    *   Lifesteal
    *   Divine Shield
    *   Poisonous
    *   On Summon Effects (Direct Damage, Buff Attack)
    *   On Attack Effects (Splash Damage)
*   **Elemental Interaction:** Basic system where Fire > Earth > Water > Fire deal +1 damage.
*   **Basic AI Opponent:** Features target prioritization logic based on threats, lethal, and basic value considerations.
*   **User Interface Refinements:**
    *   Start and Game Over menus.
    *   Deck, Hand, and Graveyard card counts.
    *   Viewable Graveyard modal.
    *   Tooltips for cards on the grid.
